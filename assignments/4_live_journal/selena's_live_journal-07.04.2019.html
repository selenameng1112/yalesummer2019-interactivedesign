          <p> My friends and I were planning to play board games in the <a href="https://morse.yalecollege.yale.edu/facilities/game-room">game room</a> in the evening;<br>
              however, the game room was so crowded that we couldnâ€™t even find a place to sit, and so were the common rooms.<br>
              Fortunately, I found an empty theater under the dining hall-a perfect place for us to make some noise ðŸ˜‰<br>
              We had so much fun that night<br>

             We are playing a Chinese card game called æ–—åœ°ä¸».<br>
             Whoever lost had to play Truth or Dare.
