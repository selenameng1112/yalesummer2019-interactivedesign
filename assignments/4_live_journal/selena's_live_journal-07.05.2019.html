              After I came to study in America, I began to explore new dancing styles, like Jazz and k-pop.<br>
              I immediately fell in love with dancing ðŸ’œðŸ’œ<br>
              At my hight school, I started a k-pop dance club and prepared performances for our schoolâ€™s talent show every year. <br>
              Since itâ€™s really difficult to find a k-pop dance teacher in NJ, I have to self-study all the dance movements through tutorials on Youtube, and then teach my club members.<br>
              Here are the links of our performances:<br>

             At YSS, I met Luna who is also full of passion for dancing.<br>
             We learned the choreography of Sweet But Psycho together in the gym today. Here is the video.
