  		<h4>When I asked myself what would change as time passes, the first thing that came to my mind is  hand. You can easily read a personâ€™s life through her hand as it grows larger and get wrinkles. Different gestures can also reflect different emotions and inner growth. Therefore, hand becomes the key element of my design.
				I designed a digital clock that will last for will last for 100 years. In this digital clock, the basic unit of time is not second or minute, but a year, and the hand that appears in the center of the page will age and change every year to represent how time goes by. Moreover, there is a personal story behind each hand that I would like to share.
				Since I am turning eighteen this November, I put the eighteenth hand in the center of the home page. The list of small images at the right of the page are the hands from past years, and you can click on one of those images to see more details. </h4>
