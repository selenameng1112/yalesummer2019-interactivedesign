    <h1>Reading Response due July 8<br><small>by Selena Meng</small></h1>
    <p>
      To me, what defines the history of Web is not just the launch dates of new browsers or services,<br>
      not just the dot-com bubbles appearing or bursting, but also the appearance of a blinking yellow button<br>
      that said “New!” or the sudden mass extinction of starry wallpapers.<br>

    <p> <storng>Questions:</strong> Do most of the web designers prefer to post their articals on existing online platforms<br>
        or to create their own webpages and post articles there?<br>
        What are the advantages of creating their own websites for their articles?(having more control?)
